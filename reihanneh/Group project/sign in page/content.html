          <h3> Foodie Code of Conduct</h3>
           
        <h3> Keep out the clutter:</h3> To make sure we collectively work towards building the highest-quality content that's useful to everyone, reviews need to be a minimum of 140 characters long for dine-in reviews.. That's just about the length of a tweet, so it's convenient even for all you micro-bloggers. If you cover the food, service and ambiance, you shouldn't fall short on characters. We do not have 140 characters limit for an online order review. However, if any review is filled with junk, we might have to remove the review altogether.
    <h3>Keep it relevant: </h3>Please keep your contributions relevant to Zomato. Accounts placing irrelevant, inappropriate,
         or promotional content, that solicit customers, or that spam restaurants, notice.or are based on any already
          disclaimed or informed policies and practices of a restaurant may be deleted without notice. 
          If your review has been removed or moderated by us and if you repost another experience for the same restaurant, 
          we reserve the right to remove that review too, even though such review might be in line with our content guidelines.
        <h3>Keep it clean:</h3> Whether you're writing a small snippet or a delightfully detailed account of your meal, 
            keep foul/abusive/hateful language, threats, and lewdness out of it. We, just like you, hate junk and will delete 
            it whenever we see it. This also includes (but is not limited to) derogatory comments on someone's 
            protected characteristics (e.g. race, gender, religion) or indication of a personal vendetta against a business 
            and its associates.
